# Al-Qasid Portal

Al-Qasid Portal is a digital application designed to provide a unified access point to a set of religious services related to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and Al-Masjid An-Nabawi, within a clean, simple, and officially aligned user experience.

The application aims to deliver trusted content and services through a smooth in-app experience, while respecting the distinct visual identity of each mosque and supporting both Arabic and English languages.

The app is built to run on Android and iOS platforms.

## Application Concept

The core idea of Al-Qasid Portal is to offer a single gateway that allows users to access multiple official digital services related to the Two Holy Mosques.

Through the application, users can:
- View upcoming prayer times based on the selected mosque
- Access Al-Fatiha content
- Browse the Haramain Recitation platform
- Read Haramain messages
- Navigate between services without leaving the application

All services are displayed within the app itself to ensure a consistent and uninterrupted user experience.

## User Experience and Visual Identity

The application dynamically adapts its visual identity based on the selected mosque.

When Al-Masjid Al-Haram is selected, a gold-based color theme is applied.
When Al-Masjid An-Nabawi is selected, a green-based color theme is applied.

This visual distinction is reflected across core UI elements such as the header, bottom navigation bar, and interactive components, ensuring a clear and respectful representation of each mosque.

The application also supports both Arabic and English languages, with proper handling of text direction and layout for each language.

## Current Scope

In its current version, the application focuses on:

- A home screen displaying the upcoming prayer in a clear and prominent manner
- Mosque selection between Al-Masjid Al-Haram and Al-Masjid An-Nabawi
- Accessing official digital services through embedded web views
- Basic settings for language selection
- A stable and production-ready design suitable for pilot use or initial release
